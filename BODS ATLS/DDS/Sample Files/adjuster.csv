SOME EMPLOYEES WERE  CALLED BACK ON 4/30/01 HOWEVER THE CLIENT DID NOT CALL IW BACK BECAUSE THEY  WERENT SURE OF HIS MEDICAL CONDITION.  IW FIRST TREATED SOMETIME IN 1/01.  ROBIN DID QUESTION THIS CLAIM FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS THE FIRST BEING THAT  THERE WAS NOT A DATE OF ACCIDENT.  THE SECOND WAS THAT SHE DIDNT THINK THAT  THIS WAS A WORKERS COMP CASE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC ACCIDENT. I  EXPLAINED THESE ISSUES WITH ROBIN.  THERE IS NO OTHER REASON THAT SHE WOULD  QUESTION THE CLAIM.  THE ONLY ACTIVITY SHE IS AWARE OF IS THAT THE IW BOWLS.  IW CONTACT  I SPOKE WITH THE IW.  HE IS 510 175 LBS.
