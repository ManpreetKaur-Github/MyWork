Our AME exam notice for Dr. Alan Sanders 10/1/08 exam to applicant came back as undeliverable.                                                                                                                                           Calls to AAs office confirmed that we have the same address as they do.  The two phone numbers they have for the applicant has been disconnected.          According to them  applicant hasnt called their office since the, deposition.  It is clear that they cannot reach the applicant at the present  time.  It is also clear that the applicant did not get the notice for this    examination.                                                                                                                                                RECOMMENDATIONS:                                                                                                                                            1.     As the application was filed on 1/30/08  dismissal per WCAB Rule 10582 is not applicable until 1/30/09.  There is really no way for us to compel an  exam to an AME  as it is agreed.                                                                                                                          2.     Absent your objections  I will give applicant counsels office until   this Friday to come up with the applicant.  If they cannot reach applicant by then  we will cancel the AME exam as there is no reason to get a cancellation, fee for an exam we cannot compel.                                                                                                                           3.     I will also advise AA that we will then set the exam with panel QME    Vahe Panossian (the only doctor left after the striking process).  If she     doesnt appear for that one  then we can compel it  and also file a DOR.  If  she doesnt appear at the hearing  then I will push for dismissal based on    the non-appearance per WCAB Rule 10562  and 10582  whichever is applicable.

HE TREATED WITH A DR.  ONLY 1 TIME HOWEVER CANNOT REMEMBER THE DRS NAME.  HE DIDNT MISS ANY TIME  FROM WORK BUT DID WORK LIGHT DUTY FOR A SHORT WHILE.  HE DENIES ANY OTHER  INJURIES OR TX FOR ANY ILLNESSES.  SUPERVISOR CONTACT  I CALLED MIKE BERT(427-6987) THE IWS SUPERVISOR DUE TO THE DISCREPANCY IN  ACCIDENT DETAILS.  HE CONFIRMED THE IWS VERSION OF THE STORY.  THE IW USED  A LADDER TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS INJURED.  THE IW WAS SLIDING OVER  TO GET BACK TO THE LADDER WHEN THE INJURY TOOK PLACE.  THE INCIDENT REPORT  ONLY GIVES 1-2 LINES FOR THE ACCIDENT INFO AND HE DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO  GIVE A CLEARER VERSION OF THE INCIDENT.  THE ACCIDENT WAS WITNESSED BY A  CO-WORKER WHO MIKE SPOKE WITH.  THE CO-WORKER SAID HE SAW IT HAPPEN AND GAVE  THE SAME DETAILS THE IW GAVE.  THERE IS NO QUESTION TO THE ACCIDENT.  SUBRO  THERE IS NO SUBROGATION ON THIS CASE AS THERE IS NO THIRD PARTY NEGLIGENCE.  THE IW JUST GOT HIS FOOT CAUGHT WHILE CLIMBING ON A CONVEYOR MACHINE.  ACTION PLAN/COMPENSABILITY  THIS IS A COMPENSABLE CLAIM FOR A LT KNEE INJURY RESULTING FROM IT BEING  TWISTED AS HE WAS CLIMBING ON A CONVEYOR MACHINE AT WORK.  THE ACCIDENT WAS  CONFIRMED BY THE CLIENT SPECIFICALLY THE IWS SUPERVISOR.  THE DRS OFFICE  DOES HAVE THIS OCCURING AT WORK AS WELL.  I HAVE ALREADY AUTHORIZED A COURSE  OF PHYSICAL THERAPY.  IW IS OOW UNTIL ATLEAST THE 5/18/01 F/U VISIT.  I WILL  F/U WITH IW AND DRS OFFICE ON THAT DATE IN REGARDS TO A POSSIBLE RTW DATE  AND A CLEARER DX.  IF THE DX REMAINS A SPRAINED KNEE AND NO SX IS NEEDED  THEN THERE WILL BE NO PERMANENCY.  IF THE INJURY NEEDS SX TO REPAIR ANY  DAMAGE THEN IT WILL CLOSE WITH A SLU OF THE LEG.  THAT WONT BE DETERMINED  UNTIL F/U VISITS ARE DONE AND FURTHER TESTING I.E. MRI.  C-669  RESERVES  INDEMNITY: $1600 WHICH REFLECTS 6 WEEKS OF LOST TIME.  IF THE KNEE WAS  INJURED ENOUGH THAT IT REQUIRES SX THE INDEMNITY WILL INCREASE  TO REFLECT A SLU.  MEDICAL:   $2000 WHICH REFLECTS PHYSICIAN COST TESTING AND PHYSICAL THERAPY  BUT MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED IF MORE EXTENSIVE TX IS NEEDED.  EXPENSES:  $1500 WHICH REFLECTS LITIGATION FEES AND POSSIBLE IME.  INDEMNITY: $11700 WHICH IS A 15% SLU.  MEDICAL:   $7000 WHICH IS FOR POSSIBLE SURGERY AND RELATED COST AND POST-OP  TX THERAPY ETC.

I WILL DENY THIS REQUEST AS THE INJURY IS  TO THE LT KNEE NOT THE RT KNEE. IT MAY BE A TYPO ERROR ON THE REPORT BUT  IF THE DR.

MD CONTACT  I RECEIVED THE 1/9/02 MEDICAL REPORT FROM DR. MECHTLER. HE GIVES ACCIDENT  DETAILS OF THE IW BEING ATTACKED AT WORK BY A COLLEAGUE. IW INITIALLY  SUFFERED TWO PUNCHES TO THE HEAD AND FELL TO THE GROUND HITTING HIS HEAD ON  THE GROUND. IW COMPLAINED OF NAUSEA VOMITING AND A SPINNING SENSATION  SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE DX AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM WAS A  CONCUSSION. DR. MECHTLER HOWEVER GIVES THE FOLLOWING AS HIS IMPRESSION:  1. POST-TRAUMATIC BENIGN POSITIONAL VERTIGO.  2. POST-TRAUMATIC CERVICAL MYOFASCIAL SYNDROME.  3. POST-TRAUMATIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN INVOLVING HIS LEFT RIBS.  ---  THE DR. IS REQUESTING AN MRI OF THE BRAIN AND ALSO VESTIBULAR THERAPY. THE  DR. THINKS THAT WITH 2 WEEKS OF THIS THERAPY THE IW SHOULD BE ABLE TO RTW.  15.8/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  IN THE 1/9/02 MEDICAL REPORT DR. MECHTLER STATES THAT THE IW HAD BYPASS SX  IN 1992.  THE IW DENIES ANY PRIOR HEAD INJURIES. THIS IS HIS FIRST WORKERS COMP CLAIM.  HE STATES THAT HE HAD BYPASS SX ABOUT 10 YRS AGO. HE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF  FXD BONES AS A KID. HE DENIES ANY OTHER INJURIES OR TX FOR ANY ILLNESSES.  IW CONTACT CONTD  THE IW WAS TOLD BY HIS DR. TO TAKE ATLEAST 2 WEEKS OFF OF WORK BUT THE IW  ISNT DOING THIS. THE IW HAS GONE IN TO WORK EVERY DAY TO ATLEAST TO CHECK IN  AND GIVE THE WORKERS THEIR DUTIES. IF HE GETS DIZZY HE GOES HOME AND USES A  VACATION DAY. IF HE ISNT DIZZY HE STAYS AT WORK. THE IW STATED THAT HE HAS  WORKED MORE THAN HE HAS BEEN OFF THOUGH. THE DR. STILL WANTS TO DO AN MRI OF  HIS BRAIN THOUGH.  MRI AUTHORIZATION  I HAVE AUTHORIZED AN MRI OF THE BRAIN THROUGH MEDFOCUS.  ACTION PLAN/COMPENSABILITY  THIS IS A COMPENSABLE INJURY FOR A CONCUSSION CAUSED FROM THE IW BEING  ATTACKED BY A CO-WORKER. I RECEIVED CONSISTENT ACCIDENT DETAILS FROM THE  CLIENT IW AND DRS MEDICAL REPORT. THE IW HAS LOST MINIMAL LOST TIME AS A  RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT. HE GOES TO WORK EVERY DAY HOWEVER DOES LEAVE EARLY  ON OCCASSION BECAUSE OF DIZZINESS. THE FIGHT WAS INITIATED DUE TO THE IW  TELLING THE CO-WORKER TO WORK HARDER AS THE IW WAS THE FOREMAN ON THE JOB.  I HAVE AUTHORIZED AN MRI OF THE BRAIN AS THE IW STILL HAS DIZZINESS. DUE TO  NO LOST TIME A BOARD FILING WILL NOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME. IF THE MRI IS  NEGATIVE AND THE SYMPTOMS GO AWAY SHORTLY I WILL CLOSE THE FILE ONCE THE  IW IS MEDICALLY DISCHARGED(IF NOT INDEXED BY THE BOARD). IF THE MRI IS  POSITIVE FOR ANY PATHOLOGY THE LONG-TERM ACTION PLAN WILL BE DETERMINED BY  THE TX PLAN.  RESERVES  MEDICAL: $4000 TO COVER 3 EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS TESTING(INCLUDED MRI AND  CT SCANS) AND DRS FEES.  2/11/02 BRAIN MRI RESULTS  IMPRESSION:  1. NORMAL MRI STUDY OF THE BRAIN.  2. MINIMAL ETHMOID SINUSITIS. A SMALL MUCOUS RETENTION CYST INVOLVING THE  MEDIAL WALL OF THE RIGHT MAXILLARY ANTRUM ALSO CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.  PT AUTHORIZATION  I HAVE AUTHORIZED PHYSICAL THERAPY TO THE NECK.  MRA REQUEST  DR. MECHTLER IS REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION FOR AN MRA OF THE BRAIN TO RULE OUT  A CAROTID EVEN VERTEBROBASILAR DISSECTION. PER THE DRS OFFICE THIS IS  DIFFERENT THAN AN MRI AS IT CONCENTRATES ON THE ARTERIES AND VEINS.  ---  I WILL FAX THE DRS OFFICE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE MRA.  4/12/02 MEDICAL  IW WAS TREATED BY DR. FALCONE. IW CONTINUES WITH A MILD PARTIAL DISABILITY.  IW STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT NECK PAIN. IMPRESSION IS CERVICAL SPRAIN/THORACIC  SPRAIN/CONTUSION LEFT RIBS.

CASE UPDATE  I HAVE AUTHORIZED AN OPEN MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE TO R/O A HERNIATED DISC.  IW CONTINUES TO WORK AND HAS A MILD PARTIAL DISABILITY. IW IS TREATING WITH  AN ORTHO AND NEURSURGEON AND ALSO GOING TO PHYSICAL THERAPY. THE NEURO GIVES  A DX OF POST-TRAUMATIC VERTIGO POST-TRAUMATIC CERVICAL MYOFACIAL SYNDROME  AND POST-TRAUMATIC HEADACHES ALL OF WHICH ARE IMPROVING ALTHOUGH HE  CONTINUES TO BE SYMPTOMATIC.  ---  IF THE CERVICAL MRI IS NEGATIVE AND NO END OF TX IS IN SIGHT I WILL CONSIDER  GETTING AN IME. I MAY NOT DO THIS AS THE CASE IS NOT YET INDEXED BY THE WCB  AND THE IW IS CONTINUING TO WORK.  11/6/02 CERVICAL MRI RESULTS  IMPRESSION:  1.

MCGOWAN FROM 2 22 01. ON JANUARY 18 2000 MR. GUY  WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT. THE ER REPORT SUPPORTS THE 18TH AS THE  CORRECT DATE. HE WAS DRIVING A 1998 CHEVY 1 TON VAN THAT BELONGS TO  TAG MECHANICL. HE WAS REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER CARE. THE TRUCK HAD NO  DAMGE. HE DROVE THE TRUCK APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES TO ONEIDA HOSPITAL.  XRAYS WERE TAKEN OF HIS NECK AND THORACID SPINE. HIS PREVIOUS FUSION  AT C6 7 WAS INTACT. HE HAS NO LOW BACK PAIN AT THE TIME. DIAGNOSIS: 1.  ACUTE SPRAIN TO THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH A POSSIBLE C4 5 DISC  HERNATION. 2. PREEXISTING DEGENERATIVE OF THE CERVICAL SPINE. 3.  PREVIOUS CERVICAL FUSION. FROM HISORY THERE IS A CUASAL RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN THE INCIDENT ON 1 18 00 2 18 00 AND MILD OCTOBER 2000 AND THE  RECURRENCE AND EXACERBATION OF HIS NECK AND UPPER EXTEEMITY STMPOTMS.  20010309 / JHH  (CONT) 10 POUNDS FREQUENTLY AND 5 POUNDS CONTINUOUSLY NO WORK MORE  THAN 18 INCHES FROM BODY.

HOWEVER HIS PREVIOUS MRI IS NOT  AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW AND I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE THAT IT WAS A HIGH  QUALITY STUDY.  20010309 / JHH  (CONT) HE MAY VERY WELL HAVE HAD A DISC HERNATION OCCUR ON EITHER THE  JANUARY OR THE FEBRUARY EVENTS. PREVIOUS IMAGING STUDIES FROM 1992 ARE  NOT AVAILABLE. THE DEGREE OF DB IS MODERATE PRTIAL AND TEMPORARY. HE  WOULD BENEFIT FROM DYNAMIC FLEXION EXTENSION VIEW OF THE CERVICAL  SPINE TO DOCUMENT THAT THERE IS NO UNRECOGNIZED CERVICAL  INSTIAIBILUTY. USE A SLFT COLLAR AT NIGHTIME AND RESTARTING AN  EXERCISE PROBRAM. THE WEAKNESS HE HAS IN THE LEFT TRICEPS IS MOST  LIKELY RESIDUAL FROM HIS RPEVIOUS FUSION AT C6 7. HE DOES NOT HAVE  NERVE TENSION FINDINGS NOW OR COMPLAINTS OF NERVE PAIN RADIATING DOWN  EITHER ARM. A CERVICAL EPIDURAL OR POSTERIOR MEDIAL BRANCH BLOCK MAY  BE HELPFUL.

I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CHEST CT SCAN FROM 10/00 AND REVIEW THE FINDINGS.  I ALSO REVIEWED DR. BECKETTS NOTE DATED 8/2/01.  THE CHEST CT WAS INTERPRETED BY THE RADIOLOGIST TO SHOW MINIMAL PLEURAL  THICKENING RIGHT UPPER POSTERIOR CHEST W/O FACL CALCIFICATION MASS OR OTHER  SPECIFIC PLEURAL ABNORMALITY. MILD PULMONARY FIBROSIS SUSPECTED W/O CONSOLID-  ATION NODULE OR OTHER ABNORMALITY. I REVIEW THE CT SCAN W/ DR. JOHN  WANDTKE CHIEF OF CHEST RADIOLOGY AND ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPT. OF  RADIOLOGY AT ROCHESTER MEDICAL CTR. WE BOTH FELT THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE  OF PULMONARY FIBROSISAND THE THE CHANGES AT THE BASES MOST LIKELY WERE  GRAVITY EFFECTS. THE CHEST CT INCLUDED BOTH STANDARD AND HIGH0-RESOLUTION  CUTS AND THERE REALLY WAS NO EVIDENCE OF INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE. WE BOTH  ADDENDUM CONTINUED  FELT THAT IF A PRON FILM HAD BEEN OBTAINED THE VERY MILD CHANGES AT THE  BASES WOULD HAVE RESOLVED. IN ADDITION THE MINIMAL DENSITY IN THE RIGHT  UPPER POSTERIOR CHEST WAS MORE LIKELY MUSCLE THAN PLEURAL THICKENING. THE  LOCATION AND ABSENCE OF BILATERAL PLEURAL CHANGES IS ATYPICAL FOR ASBESTPS-  INDUCED PLEURAL PLAQUE.  THUS MY CONCLUSIONS FROM MY REPORT DATED 5/29/01 ARE ESSENTIALY UNCHANGED.  I FIND NEITHER EVIDENC OF PLEURAL PLAQUE NOR PULMONARY FIBROSIS ON THE CHEST  CT SCAN. I DID POINT OUT IN THE EARLIER REPORT THAT PLEURAL THICKENING  DETECTD IN THE RIGHT UPPER POSTERIOR CHEST IS NOT TYPICAL OF ASBESTOS  PLAQUES AS THEY ARE USUSALLY ALONG THE LATERAL MID-CHEST AND TYPICALLY  BILATERAL.  SUPPLEMENTAL IME REPORT  THE IME DOC DR.UTELL REVIEWED THE 10/00 CHEST CT AND OPINED  THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS FROM MY REPORT DATED 5/29/01 ARE ESSENTIALLY  UNCHANGED.

HE HAS SPOKEN ALREADY TO ADJ AND SUPERVISOR. CHECK WAS DUE TO HIM  2-14.  WE DID NOT ISSUE UNTIL 2-18 HE RECD 2-25. HE HAD WRITTEN CHECKS  THINKING HIS WC CHECK WOULD ARRIVE IN TIME - IT WAS LATE ONLY ONCE AND NOT  OUR FAULT.  HE HAD EXPECTED THE CHECK SO HE WROTE  CHECKS AND 11 BOUNCED. HE WANTS US TO  PAY THE BOUNCE FEE FOR 7 OF THE CHECKS AS HE FEELS THERE WAS MONEY THERE FOR  5 OF THEM AND THE BANK MADE A MISTAKE ON THOSE  THE CHARGES WERE $ 25 PER BOUNCED CHECK X 5 = $ 175. HE WILL SEND PROOF  EXPLAINED THAT WE DO NOT ISSUE DIRECT DEPOSITS - IT IS NOT FISCALLY  RESPONSIBLE TO WRITE CHECKS WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK. HE ARGUES  HIS CHECK WAS DUE 2-14 AND HE DID NOT RECEIVE UNTIL 2-25  HE WOULD ACEPT NO - WANTED PRESIDENT OF COMPANY. ADVISED I WOULD REVIEW  IW COMPLAINT  IW CALLED TO TO EXPRESS HIS UNHAPPINESS WITH THE LATE ISSUANCE OF HIS 2/01/02  TO 2/14/02 CHECK WHICH WAS ISSUED ON 2/18/02. THIS WAS MY FAULT DUE TO NOT  ADDRESSING THE LTV DIARY TIMELY. ACCORDING TO THE IW HE HAD ISSUED PERSONAL  CHECKS (11) TO DEBTORS IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING HIS BENEFIT CHECK TIMELY.  HE FEELS THAT WE SHOULD REIMBURSME HIM FOR THE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FEES THAT  HE ENCOUNTERED. I DID APOLOGIZE FOR THE UNTIMELY PAYMENT HOWEVER WAS NOT  WILLING TO PAY FOR NSF CHECK FEES. ISSUING CHECKS  BEFORE HAVING THE FUNDS  AVAILABLE WAS HIS DECISION. HE DISAGREES WITH MY POSITION AND WANTED TO SPEAK  WITH MY SUPERVISOR. I GAVE HIM JAY MARTINOS NAME AND NUMBER. APPARENTLY JAY  ALSO FELT THAT WE SHOULDNT AUTOMATICALLY AGREE TO PAY FOR THESE FEES WITHOUT  CONTACTING DEFENSE COUNSEL. THE IW THEN WENT TO TERRY SMITH. TERRY EXPLAINED  THAT WE NEED TO RESEARCH AND GET BACK TO HIM. (CONTINUED ON NEXT ENTRY)  IW COMPLAINT  I CALLED DENNIS GOODRICH TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE AND WAS INFORMED THAT WE ARE  UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THESE FEES. UNDER WC LAW WE MUST MAKE PAYMENT  WITHIN 18 DAYS. THE BENEFIT PERIOD OF 2/01/02 THROUGH 2/14/02 WAS PAID ON  2/18/02 WHICH IS WITHIN THE 18 DAY TIME CONSTRAINT. TECHNICALLY THIS LAW  ONLY APPLIES WHEN WE ARE UNDER DIRECTION TO CCP. SINCE I VOLUNTARILY PICKED  UP PAYMENTS WE ARE UNDER NO TIME CONSTRAINTS. OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT OUR  INTENT TO ISSUE UNTIMELY PAYMENTS. THIS WAS A ERROR ON THE ADJUSTERS PART AND  THE IWS ERROR FOR ISSUING CHECKS WITHOUT FUNDS. ULTIMATELY THE DECISION TO  REIMBURSE THE IW WILL COME FROM TERRY SMITH. E-MAIL SENT TO TERRY ON 3/4/02  ADVISING HER OF OUR OBLIGATION AND REQUEST FOR FUTURE HANDLING INSTRUCTION.  IW COMPLAINT  SPOKE TO IW. EXPLAINED THAT THE CHECK WAS NOT LATE ACCORDING TO NY LAW  AND WE WOULD NOT BE REIMBURSING ANY BANK FEES.
